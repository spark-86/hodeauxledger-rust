# Râ¬¢ (Rhex) Record Model

## ðŸ“¦ The outer package

```rust
pub struct Rhex {
    pub magic: [u8; 6],                 // "RHEX\x00\x01"
    pub intent: Intent,                 // Original Intent Data
    pub context: Context,               // Context Data provided by the rec. usher
    pub signatures: Vec<Signature>,     // Author, Usher and Quorum signatures
    pub current_hash: Option<[u8; 32]>  // Hash of the complete record
}
```

## ðŸª„ Believe in Magic

Magic is the control bytes. First 4 are always "RHEX", the next is 8 flags, and the final byte is the version number.

### Flags

-   `0000 0001` - MORE: There are more Râ¬¢ after this one.
-   `0000 0010` - RESUME: Do we resume on a failed submission? Only applies to streams of Râ¬¢. 1 = resume after fail, 0 = abort on fail.
-   `0000 0100` - METADATA: This Râ¬¢ contains metadata, and is not part of the actual chain
-   `0000 1000` - RESERVED
-   `0001 0000` - RESERVED
-   `0010 0000` - RESERVED
-   `0100 0000` - RESERVED
-   `1000 0000` - RESERVED

## ðŸ“œ The Intent

The intent is the initial information provided by the Author. Signature is of the Blake3 hash over the CBOR intent.

```rust
pub struct Intent {
    pub previous_hash: [u8; 32],      // Hash of the previous record
    pub scope: String,                // Scope name
    pub nonce: String,                // Nonce to prevent replay attacks
    pub author_public_key: [u8; 32],  // Author's public key
    pub usher_public_key: [u8; 32],   // Usher's public key
    pub record_type: String,          // Record type
    pub data: serde_json::Value       // Record data in JSON format
}
```

## ðŸ•” Context Matters

The context is the information provided by the Usher at the time of submission. Currently the usher's hash is H(Author sig || context.at).

```rust
pub struct Context {
    pub at: u64;   // Time in micromarks. Time is monotonic and starts at 0 so no need for i128 here.
}
```

## ðŸ”‘ Signatures

Here lies the Author, Usher, and Quorum. Three friends that bind each other in honesty.

```rust
pub struct Signature {
    pub sig_type: u8,          // 0 = Author, 1 = Usher, 2 = Quorum
    pub public_key: [u8; 32],  // Public key of the signer
    pub signature: [u8; 64]    // Ed25519 signature of the hash so it's always 64 bytes
}
```
